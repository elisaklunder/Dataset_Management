which attributes should be private/bublic? (especially root, data, labels)

should we have getters setters for all private ones?

(in the hierarchical thing) if the classes need to be in the root, how tf do we recognize them??

how are things getting appended in the labels list, both in csv format and hierarchical

lazy loader how does it work? should it have a load_batch function or do it all in load_data?
