# Report

# should data and labels (when there are labels) be two different lists or one single one or a dictionary or smth

# which attributes should be private/bublic? (especially root, data, labels)

should we have getters setters for all private ones?

(in the hierarchical thing) if the classes need to be in the root, how tf do we recognize them??

how are things getting appended in the labels list, both in csv format and hierarchical

# -lazy loader how does it work? should it have a load_batch function or do it all in load_data? or maybe we use open/load in the libraries themselves?

# should train test split work so that it only splits the already loaded data? 

# for eli
why cant I install librosa?
